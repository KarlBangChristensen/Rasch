Local response dependence occurs when items are almost identical (redundancy) or when they share features. It can be evaluated using the Yen(1981) Q3 and the two versions of it (Q3,max and Q3,\*)  discussed by Christensen, Makransky & Horton (2017). The SAS macro %rasch_Q3.sas can be used to compute these
