Local response dependence occurs when items are almost identical (redundancy) or when they share features. It can be evaluated using Yen's Q3 and the two versions (Q3,max and Q3,\*) of it discussed by Cristensen et al.

, e.g., was evaluated using the statistic (Christensen, Makransky, Horton, 2017). The SAS macro %rasch_Q3.sas can be used to compute
